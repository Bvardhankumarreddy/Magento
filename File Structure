In Magento 2, modules will be live in app/code directory of a Magento installation, with this format: app/code/<Vendor>/<ModuleName>.

Module:- The module is a directory that contains blocks, controllers, models, helper, etc - that are related to a specific business feature. 
The etc folder contains admin ACL, admin menu, configuration. 

Vendor:- The vendor can provide all information about the store, as well as design the profile page by adding their logo, banner, etc. 
Product creation and promo options. Allow your vendors to create any type of product: configurable, bundle, grouped, simple, downloadable, and virtual.

Controller specially is one of the important thing in Module development series, and PHP MVC Framework in general. It functionarity is that received 
request, process and render page.

In Magento 2 Controller has one or more files in Controller folder of module, it includes actions of class which contain execute() method. There are 2 
different controllers, they are frontend controller and backend controller. They are generally similar of workflow, but admin controller is a little
different. There is a checking permission method in admin controller, it calls form key.


How Controller works?

It receive an request from end-user (browser or comamnd line), for example: http://example.com/route_name/controller/action

=> route_name is a unique name which is set in routes.xml.
=> controller is the folder inside Controller folder.
=> action is a class with execute method to process request.

One of the important in Magento system is frontController (Magento\Framework\App\FrontController), it alway receives request then route controller, 
action by route_name Let’s take an example of routing an request:

foreach ($this->_routerList as $router) {
   try {
      $actionInstance = $router->match($request);
   …
}

If there is an action of controller class found, execute() method will be run.

Composer.json => Composer the ability to install this module, its dependency and another meta data.
 
     dependency => A dependency is an additional code that a programmer wants to call.Adding a dependency avoids repeating work already done: designing, 
                   writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining a specific unit of code.

Registration.php => this file registers the module with magento

Block => It contains php view classes as part of MVC.

Controller => It contains php controller classes as part of MVC

etc => It contains configuration files like as module.xml, menu.xml, system.xml, routes.xml, events.xml etc

etc/module.xml => This file specifies the name and setup version of this module, as well as dependency

etc/acl.xml => The acl.xml file defines the access control list (ACL) for a given module. It defines the avaliable set of permissions to access the
               resources.
               
etc/config.xml => It's system configuration

etc/di.xml  => The di.xml file configures whih dependencies to inject by the object manager. Each module can have a global and area-specific di.xml file.

etc/events.xml => Your unique event name is referenced in your module's events.xml where you

etc/adminhtml/menu.xml => This xml files adds new menu items to the magento admin

etc/adminhtml/routes.xml =>  The contents of this xml file tells Magento to route requests that use the frontName of this module.

etc/adminhtml/system.xml => This is a sconfiguration file which is used to create configuration fields in 2 system configuration

i18n => It contains localization files

Setup => It contains classes for module database structure and data setup which are invoked when installing or upgrading.

View => It contains view files, including static view files, design templates, email templates and layout files.

Plugin => It contains plugin class. A class that modifies the behavior of original, public methods for any class or interface.

Helper => The helper class conatains the methods. Methods can be called from any template, file, block, model, controller class or even from another
helper.

Required Files (While creation of a module)

=> registration.php
=> etc/module.xml
=> composer.json

Where is the custom module present?

=> If you install module by composer then module goes to "vendor/vendorName/ModuleName"
=> If you install module by manual upload to "app/code/vendoname/modulename"

frontName – it’s set in routes.xml configuration, and has unique value which will be matched by router
action path – folder name inside Controller folder, default is index
action class – our action class which we call Controller, default is index
