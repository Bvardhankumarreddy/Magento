In Magento 2, modules will be live in app/code directory of a Magento installation, with this format: app/code/<Vendor>/<ModuleName>.

Module:- The module is a directory that contains blocks, controllers, models, helper, etc - that are related to a specific business feature. 
The etc folder contains admin ACL, admin menu, configuration. 

Vendor:- The vendor can provide all information about the store, as well as design the profile page by adding their logo, banner, etc. 
Product creation and promo options. Allow your vendors to create any type of product: configurable, bundle, grouped, simple, downloadable, and virtual.

Controller specially is one of the important thing in Module development series, and PHP MVC Framework in general. It functionarity is that received 
request, process and render page.

In Magento 2 Controller has one or more files in Controller folder of module, it includes actions of class which contain execute() method. There are 2 
different controllers, they are frontend controller and backend controller. They are generally similar of workflow, but admin controller is a little
different. There is a checking permission method in admin controller, it calls form key.


How Controller works?

It receive an request from end-user (browser or comamnd line), for example: http://example.com/route_name/controller/action

=> route_name is a unique name which is set in routes.xml.
=> controller is the folder inside Controller folder.
=> action is a class with execute method to process request.

One of the important in Magento system is frontController (Magento\Framework\App\FrontController), it alway receives request then route controller, 
action by route_name Let’s take an example of routing an request:

foreach ($this->_routerList as $router) {
   try {
      $actionInstance = $router->match($request);
   …
}

If there is an action of controller class found, execute() method will be run.
