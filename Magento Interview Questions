EAV in intended for databases in which a higher number of attributes are used to identify a single entity, but not all this attributes are relevant to
that entity.

When you use this model, only empty-data values are kept. Although this model all for more efficient storage, it is more complicated than the falt model 
since developers must execute many queries to obtain all of the information about a product or item.

Ans) The EAV databse model is completely normalized. Each column's values is stored in its data type database, making it more complicated beause they 
must combine 5-6 tables even if only one detail is required. Columns are referred to as characteristics in EAV.

Only one table is used in the flat model. It isn't normalized, thus it keep extra space in the database. It's ideal for dynamic requirements in which 
you need to add extra columns in the future. It's performance is quick beacuse it doesn't to join 5-6 tables. Columns are reffered to as fields in the
flat model.
