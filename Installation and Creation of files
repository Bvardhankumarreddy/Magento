1. Install Brew 

Homebrew is a free and opensource software package management system that simplifies the installation of software on Apple's operating system, macos 
as well as linux. The name is inteded to suggest the idea of building software on the Mac depending on the user's taste. Orginally written by Max Howell,
the package manager has gained popularity in the Ruby on Rails community and earned praise for its extensibility. Homebrew has been recomended for its ease
of use as well as its integration into the command line interface.

Homebrew has made extensive use of github to expand the support of several packages through user contributions. In 2010 Homebrew as the third-most forked 
repositiry on github. In 2012, Homebrew had the largest number of new contributors on Github. In 2013, Homebrew had both the largest number contributors
and issues closed of any project on github.

Homebrew has spaned several sub-projects such as Linuxbrew, a linux port now officially merged into Homebrew; Homebrew cask, which builds upon Homebrew and
focuses on the installation of GUI applications; and "taps" dedicated to specific areas or programming languages like PHP.

3. Install Composer

Composer is a application-level dependency manager for the PHP programming language that provides a standard format for managing dependencies of PHP
software and required libararies. It was developed by Nils Adermann and Jordi Boggiano, who continues to manage the project. Composer is strongly 
inspired by Node.js "npm" and Ruby "bundler". The project's dependency sloving algorithm started out as a PHP-based port of openSUSE's libzypp
satsolver. Composer is not a package manager in the samesense as a Yum or Apt are. Yes, it deals with "packages" or libraries, but it manages them
on a per-project basis, installing them in a directory (e.g vendor) inside your project.



composer runs the command line and installs dependencies for an application. It also allows users to install PHP applications that are avaliable on 
"Packagist" which is its main repository conatining avaliable packages.It also provides autoload capabilities for libariries that specify autoload
information to ease usage of third-party code.

=> require: add the library in parameter to the file composer.json, and install it.
=> install: install all libraries from composer.json. It's the command to use to download all PHP repository dependencies.
=> update: update all libraries from composer.json, according to the allowed versions mentioned into it.
=> remove: uninstall a library and remove it from composer.json.


Composer:

Enables you to declare the libraries you depend on.
Finds out which versions of which packages can and need to be installed, and installs them (meaning it downloads them into your project).
You can update all your dependencies in one command.

https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md Open the following link to download the
composer setup file: https://getcomposer.org/installer

PROCESS TO INSTALL

1) php composer-setup.php --install-dir=bin --filename=composer

Check composer installation by typing:
composer -v

or 

1) brew install composer


4. Set PHP Path

open terminal and type the following command: -

nano ~/.bash_profile

Put the following code inside and save:

PATH="/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php7.4.21/bin:$PATH”

==> To edit the path press i
==> To come out of edit press esc to get back from editing options

then press command+qw if this not work command+wq (Any one of these command may work)

5. Download Magento

Download Magento from either github or the official website
Move the folder under htdocs and rename it to whatever you want
We have renamed it to for this installation

link to downlaod magento => https://magefan.com/blog/download-magento-245-zip-archive

Install composer In magento root folder

Move to magento root folder in terminal and type:  command => composer install

Give yes to all permissions in terminal


Move files from pub to root folder

Move the .htaccess and index.php file from pub to the root magento folder Edit line 12 in index.php in magento root: From

require __DIR__ . '/../app/bootstrap.php';
To
require __DIR__ . '/app/bootstrap.php';


Setup magento database

Go to phpMyAdmin and create a new database called magento2

Final magento installation command

Edit the following command in terminal according to your credentials to setup magento2: - 

php -d memory_limit=2G  bin/magento setup:install --base-url=http://localhost:8888/magento2 
--db-host=localhost:8889 --db-name=magento2 --db-user=root --db-password=root --admin-firstname=vardhan 
--admin-lastname=kumar --admin-email=bhopathivardhan654321@gmail.com --admin-user=admin --admin-password=admin123 --language=en_US 
--currency=USD --timezone=America/Chicago --use-rewrites=1 --search-engine=elasticsearch7 --elasticsearch-host=localhost --elasticsearch-port=9200


Copy and save the admin link that is displayed for later use



Final SQL Queries

Go to phpMyAdmin, navigate to the magento2 database and execute the following sql:


INSERT INTO `core_config_data` (`config_id`, `scope`, `scope_id`, `path`, `value`,
`updated_at`) VALUES (NULL, 'default', '0', 'web/secure/base_static_url',
'http://localhost:8888/magento2/pub/static/', current_timestamp());
INSERT INTO `core_config_data` (`config_id`, `scope`, `scope_id`, `path`, `value`,
`updated_at`) VALUES (NULL, 'default', '0', 'web/unsecure/base_static_url',
'http://localhost:8888/magento2/pub/static/', current_timestamp());
INSERT INTO `core_config_data` (`config_id`, `scope`, `scope_id`, `path`, `value`,
`updated_at`) VALUES (NULL, 'default', '0', 'web/secure/base_media_url',
'http://localhost:8888/magento2/pub/media/', current_timestamp());
INSERT INTO `core_config_data` (`config_id`, `scope`, `scope_id`, `path`, `value`,
`updated_at`) VALUES (NULL, 'default', '0', 'web/unsecure/base_media_url',
'http://localhost:8888/magento2/pub/media/', current_timestamp());


Now clear cache using:
 php bin/magento cache:flush
 
 Installation Done
    Navigate to http://localhost:8888/magento2/ to go to the magento home page
    Navigate to http://localhost:8888/magento2/ to go to the admin page
