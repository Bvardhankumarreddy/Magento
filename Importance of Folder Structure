The folder structure in magento is important for different reasons.

1. It helps to organize the different files and resiurces of the magento application, making it easier to find and maintain them.
2. It allows the magento application to function properly by providing a clear separation of responsibilities and a hierarchy of files and structures.
3. It helps to ensure that the magento application can be extended and customized easily by allowing developers to add new code and resoures in the 
appropriate locations.
4. It helps to improve the security and stability of the magento application by keeping sensitive files and resources separate from publicly accessible ones.

Magento Directory Structure 

The directory structure of magento consists of three types:-

1) Basic Structure
2) Module Structure
3) Design Structure

/RootDirectory

app – This folder contains the core files of Magento 2, including configuration, modules, and themes files.
By default, the Magento repository’s basic installation contains three main folders, i.e., design, etc., and i18n. The code folder is missing, but all 
the custom code development and third-party integration modules are in the app/code with the directory app/code/VendorName//ModuleName.

Store custom design theme structure is under the app/design/frontend subdirectory, and the admin theme is under the app/design/adminhtml subdirectory.

To store language packages, the app/i18n directory is your need to help you create a multi-language store.

Besides, to avoid custom modules being mixed with the core modules of Magento, you need to add all Magento core modules in the vendor directory. This is
because, unlike in Magento 1 version,  where all their Magento core modules had to be committed to their Git repository, with Magento 2, these two are 
separated.


bin: It contains the Magento 2 CLI executable script feature. Using CLI would require SSH access to the server. The Magento 2 CLI can help install 
modules, upgrade the application core, reindex, compile, etc.

dev: This contains various developer tools, such as Magento Test Framework (MTF) for functional test units.

generated:  This includes two subdirectories code and metadata with all the Magento 2 generated code of all the injected classes. 
The command can remove it: rm -r <magento_root>/generated/*/* to re-generate the nonfactory classes by the composer.

lib: This directory contains libraries packed separately from the Magento 2 core libraries.

phpserver: This folder contains the Router.php file, the functional unit of the php Built-in web server. However, working on this file for a security 
breach is strongly recommended.

pub: Stores the file index.php and all generated static files and site media. It should be set as your web root on the server side. As the name says, 
it contains all the publicly accessible files.

setup: Several important packages, such as the performance toolkit, database scripts, and installation setup, are available in this setup directory.

var: The var folder contains raw sessions, cache, database backups, and cached error reports. This regenerates the contents of numerous subdirectories 
when running the command bin/magento setup:di:compile.
